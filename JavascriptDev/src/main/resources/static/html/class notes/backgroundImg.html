        Taipei (/ˌtaɪˈpeɪ/;[4] Mandarin: [tʰǎipèi]; Hokkien POJ: Tâi-pak), officially known as Taipei City, is the
        capital[note 1] and a special municipality of Taiwan (officially the Republic of China, "ROC"). Located in
        northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about 25 km (16 mi)
        southwest of the northern port city Keelung. Most of the city is located in the Taipei Basin, an ancient
        lakebed. The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to
        form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.[5]

        The city proper is home to an estimated population of 2,704,810 (2015),[6] forming the core part of the
        Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area, which includes the nearby cities of New Taipei and Keelung with a population
        of 7,047,559,[6][7] the 40th most-populous urban area in the world—roughly one-third of Taiwanese citizens live
        in the metro district. The name "Taipei" can refer either to the whole metropolitan area or the city proper.

        Taipei is the political, economic, educational, and cultural center of Taiwan and one of the major hubs in East
        Asia. Considered to be a global city and rated as an Alpha City by GaWC,[8] Taipei is part of a major high-tech
        industrial area.[9] Railways, high-speed rail, highways, airports, and bus lines connect Taipei with all parts
        of the island. The city is served by two airports – Songshan and Taoyuan. Taipei is home to various world-famous
        architectural or cultural landmarks, which include Taipei 101, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Dalongdong Baoan
        Temple, Hsing Tian Kong, Lungshan Temple of Manka, National Palace Museum, Presidential Office Building, Taipei
        Guest House, Ximending, and several night markets dispersed throughout the city. Natural features such as
        Maokong, Yangmingshan, and hot springs are also well known to international visitors.

        In English-language news reports the name Taipei often serves as a synecdoche referring to central government of
        Taiwan. Due to the ambiguous political status of Taiwan internationally, the term Chinese Taipei is also
        frequently pressed into service as a synonym for the entire country, as when Taiwan's governmental
        representatives participate in international organizations or Taiwan's athletes participate in international
        sporting events.
