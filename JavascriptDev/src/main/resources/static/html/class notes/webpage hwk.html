                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Tillandsia is a genus of around 650 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family
                    Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of northern Mexico and south-eastern
                    United
                    States, Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to mid Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color,
                    are
                    covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.
                </p></br>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    They are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological
                    differences making this genus an excellent example of diversity. Having native habitats that vary
                    from
                    being epiphytic and saxicolous, species have certain adaptations, such as root systems designed to
                    anchor to other plants or substrates, and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake. Some of
                    the
                    species, like the majority of bromeliaceae, grow as funnel bromelia, whose stem axis is compressed.
                    The
                    leaves are then close together in rosettes, thereby cover the lower areas of the leaves, so that a
                    funnel for collecting water.

                    Leaf rosettes, which is a common physical characteristic in Tillandsia species, function as a source
                    of
                    nutrients, water, and as a water and humus-gathering organ. Floral characteristics typically involve
                    bright, vibrant colours, with either blooms or inflorescence being produced on a stalk. The colour
                    varies between red, yellow, purple and pink, which helps attract pollinators. These colour
                    variations
                    can also occur on the air plants' foliage during its blooming season. The hermaphrodite flowers are
                    threefold with double perianth. The three free sepals are symmetrical and pointed. The seeds have a
                    "parachute" similar to the dandelion.

                    Common pollinators of this genera include moths, hummingbirds and, more recently recognized, bats.

                <h2>Cultivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Tillandsias, like other bromeliads, can multiply through pollination and seed formation. Since
                    Tillandsia are not self-fertile, the pollen must come from another plant of the same species.
                    Tillandsie
                    takes many years to flower. With the fruiting the life of the individual species has come to the
                    end.
                    There are still seeds formed, then the mother plant is destroyed.

                    Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas
                    more
                    subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew,
                    dust,
                    decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes. Air plants are growing
                    rapidly
                    in popularity as a low maintenance household plant. Due to their minimal root system and other
                    adaptations, they generally do not require frequent watering, no more than four times a week,
                    allowing
                    the plant to completely dry before watering again.

                    The amount of light required depends on the species; overall, air plants with silver dusting and
                    stiff
                    foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage. They generally need a strong
                    light. In summer outside, however, they prefer the light shade of a tree at the hottest hours.
                    Plants
                    are commonly seen mounted, placed in a terrarium, or simply placed in seashells as decorative
                    pieces.
                    For so-called "aerial" species (the majority of the common species in culture except Tillandsia
                    cyanea),
                    that is to say those whose roots are transformed into crampons without any power of absorption,
                    watering
                    is done by the leaves in the form of frequent sprays, or brief soaking of the plant in a container
                    full
                    of water. It is imperative to use non-calcareous water. Rainwater recovered from the flow of a mossy
                    or
                    green roof is best for this purpose, if available.
