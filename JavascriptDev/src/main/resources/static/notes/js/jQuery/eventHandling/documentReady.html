    <h1>document ready()</h1>
    <p>
        ready()<br/>
        -------<br/>
        jQuery fires a <b>custom event named 'ready' when the DOM is loaded</b> and available for manipulation.<br/>
        You can attach as many ready() events to the document as you would like.<br/>
        They are executed in the order they were added top down in script tag.<br/>
        FYI: ready() triggers before CSS is loaded. After jQuery 1.3, always include all CSS files before any jQuery code.<br/>
        FYI: ready() triggers as script is parsed, not after.<br/>

        onload()<br/>
        --------<br/>
        jQuery window.onload event loads after all assets including all scripts are loaded.<br/>
    </p>

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        // This is a common pattern seen with jQuery usage.

        /************************************************************************************
        jQuery window.onload event loads after all assets including all scripts are loaded
        ************************************************************************************/
        jQuery(window).load(function () {

        /************************************************************************************
        jQuery has custom read() functions after DOM loads but before SCRIPT loads.
        These 3 jQuery ready() functions fire in the order they're written (top to bottom)
        The custom ready() event is not entirely needed. 
        If your JavaScript code does not affect the DOM, you can include it anywhere in the HTML document. 
        This means you can avoid the ready() event altogether if your JavaScript code is not dependent on the DOM being intact.

            // Shortcut with fail-safe usage of $. A reference to the jQuery function is passed
            //  into the anonymous function. Use $() without fear of conflicts.
