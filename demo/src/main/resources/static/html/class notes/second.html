    <h2 title="h2 tag">Summary</h2>
    <p>Draco (/ˈdreɪkoʊ/; Greek: Δράκων, Drakōn; fl. c. 7th century BC), also called Drako or Drakon, was the first
        recorded legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece. </p>
    <p>He replaced the prevailing system of oral law and blood feud by a written code to be enforced only by a court of
        law.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 title="h2 tag">Life</h2>
    <p style="background-color: chartreuse;">Little is known about his life. He may have belonged to the Greek nobility of Attica, with which the 10th-century
        Suda text records him as contemporaneous, prior to the period of the Seven Sages of Greece. </p>
    <p>It also relates a
        folkloric story of his death in the Aeginetan theatre.[4]</p>
    <br />
    <h2 title="h2 tag">Draconian constitution</h2>
    <p>The laws (θεσμοί - thesmoi) that he laid were the first written constitution of Athens. So that no one would be
        unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets (ἄξονες - axones), where they were preserved for almost two
        centuries on steles of the shape of three-sided pyramids (κύρβεις - kyrbeis).[7]</p>
    <p>The tablets were called axones, perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid's axis to read any side.</p>
